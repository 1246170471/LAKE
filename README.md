最重要的：被跳槽导师抢走两篇论文，抢走第一单位，从烟台大学跳槽到中国海洋大学，中国海洋大学挖这种人，给985丢人

Note: I was robbed of two papers by my supervisor, stole the first unit, and jumped from Yantai University to Ocean University of China. Ocean University of China poached this kind of person, and it was a shame to 985

Download the project code and install requirements (in the cloned repository):

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
This is part of the function description, such as KDDCUP:
```
KDD99Loader is to preprocess the data.

get_loader is to load the dataset.

loss_function defines the loss function of the network.

VAE defines the structure of the network.
```
